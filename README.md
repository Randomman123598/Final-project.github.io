# Final-project.github.io Jalil Johnson

My name is Jalil Johnson, a student at Mt Eden High School in Ap Comp-Sci a programmer learning how to build functional, creative, and user-friendly web applications. Over the past year, I’ve explored front-end and back-end development tools, practiced writing clean and efficient code, and learned how to turn ideas into interactive digital experiences. I'm continuing to grow as a programmer in this class and always looking for new ways to challenge myself and improve my skills.

About This Project

This is my final portfolio project is the culmination of my work throughout the year. It showcases my growth as a programmer. Throughout this process, I learned how to organize and present my work, build responsive layouts, and use GitHub Pages to host and deploy a live site. I also developed a stronger understanding of project planning, debugging, and version control using Git.

Portfolio Overview

My portfolio site is a fully responsive, multi-page application that includes:

- A polished landing page with a short introduction and navigation
- A dedicated section highlighting selected projects
- A brief summary of my skills and tools I’ve worked with
- A contact section where visitors can reach out or view more of my work

Featured Projects

Here are the main projects included in my portfolio, each with a short description:

### 1. **[Project Title 1]**
A brief description of what the project does and its purpose. For example: A JavaScript quiz app that tests users on coding trivia. Features include a timer, score tracker, and localStorage integration.

### 2. **[Project Title 2]**
Another short summary. For example: A to-do list web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, remove, and filter tasks with a clean and responsive design.
